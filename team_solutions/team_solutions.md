Goal was to explore applications of Quantum Machine Learning. Explored Covalent packages with Qiskit but had issue coming up with a complete pipeline. We explore other topics in machine learning and also deployment for scalability. We wanted to implement Qiskit in the classification model. 


Pipeline implemented: 

  1. Dataset- Yoga poses - http://download.tensorflow.org/data/pose_classification/yoga_poses.zip

  2. Model: MoveNetfollowed by pose classification model in Tensorflow. 

  3. Input: RGB Image from webcam -> Output is Pose CLassifier.

  4. Architecture: Movenet outputs key human pose 2Dpoints which is fed to the Pose Classifier.
