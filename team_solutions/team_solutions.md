Goal was to explore applications of Quantum Machine Learning. We wanted to implement Qiskit in the classification model and explore Covalent packages with Qiskit but had issue coming up with a complete pipeline. We explored other topics in machine learning and also deployment for scalability. 


Pipeline implemented: 

  1. Dataset- Yoga poses - http://download.tensorflow.org/data/pose_classification/yoga_poses.zip

  2. Model: MoveNetfollowed by pose classification model in Tensorflow. 

  3. Input: RGB Image from webcam -> Output is Pose CLassifier.

  4. Architecture: Movenet outputs key human pose 2Dpoints which is fed to the Pose Classifier. 


Future Work
  1. Implement the above machine learning architecture with covalend and Qiskit.
  2. Make cloud friendly architecture by deploying it in AWS or IBM cloud
